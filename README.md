 // created a website that generates either stats on a random pokemon or the stats of a pokemon you search.

// Daniel Herrera : You design is excellent and it is Fully Responsive!
Here's some suggestions I recommend to be implemented!
    You are missing the shiny version image
    Add some padding to the input field when user enters a name or number!
    Have the moves list become scrollable so the user doesn't have to scroll down too much!

Other than that, I really like your design!
